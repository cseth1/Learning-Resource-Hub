## Database
PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for the Learning Resource Hub. The database schema includes the following main tables:

- Users: Stores user account information
  - Columns: id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
- Resources: Contains details about educational resources
  - Columns: id, title, description, url, type, subject, difficulty_level, created_at, updated_at
- UserInteractions: Tracks user activities and preferences
  - Columns: id, user_id, resource_id, interaction_type, timestamp
- Comments: Stores user comments on resources
  - Columns: id, user_id, resource_id, content, created_at, updated_at

Key features of the PostgreSQL implementation:
1. Indexing: CREATE INDEX statements are used to create indexes on frequently queried columns, improving query performance. For example:
   CREATE INDEX idx_resources_title ON resources(title);

2. Foreign Key Constraints: FOREIGN KEY constraints are defined to maintain referential integrity. For instance:
   ALTER TABLE user_interactions
   ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user
   FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id);

3. Full-Text Search: PostgreSQL's tsvector and tsquery types are utilized for efficient full-text search. Example:
   ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;
   CREATE INDEX textsearch_idx ON resources USING GIN (search_vector);
   UPDATE resources SET search_vector = to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description);

4. JSONB Columns: JSONB data type is used for flexible, schema-less data storage. For example:
   ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN metadata JSONB;
   CREATE INDEX idx_resources_metadata ON resources USING GIN (metadata);

Database connection and ORM:
// Database connection and ORM setup using Sequelize

const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

// Create Sequelize instance
const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DB_NAME, process.env.DB_USER, process.env.DB_PASSWORD, {
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  dialect: 'postgres',
  logging: false, // Disable logging; set to console.log for debugging
  pool: {
    max: 5,
    min: 0,
    acquire: 30000,
    idle: 10000
  }
});

// Test the connection
async function testConnection() {
  try {
    await sequelize.authenticate();
    console.log('Connection to the database has been established successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', error);
  }
}

testConnection();

// Define models
const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  username: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true
  },
  email: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true,
    validate: {
      isEmail: true
    }
  },
  password_hash: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  }
}, {
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: true
});

const Resource = sequelize.define('Resource', {
  title: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  },
  description: Sequelize.TEXT,
  url: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    validate: {
      isUrl: true
    }
  },
  type: Sequelize.STRING,
  subject: Sequelize.STRING,
  difficulty_level: Sequelize.INTEGER,
  metadata: Sequelize.JSONB
}, {
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: true
});

const UserInteraction = sequelize.define('UserInteraction', {
  interaction_type: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  },
  timestamp: {
    type: Sequelize.DATE,
    defaultValue: Sequelize.NOW
  }
}, {
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false
});

// Define associations
User.hasMany(UserInteraction);
UserInteraction.belongsTo(User);
Resource.hasMany(UserInteraction);
UserInteraction.belongsTo(Resource);

// Sync models with database
sequelize.sync({ alter: true })
  .then(() => console.log('Database & tables created!'))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error syncing database:', error));

module.exports = {
  sequelize,
  User,
  Resource,
  UserInteraction
};

- The application uses Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with PostgreSQL.
- Database connection details are stored in environment variables for security.
- Connection pooling is implemented to efficiently manage database connections.

# Migrations and Seeding

## Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed using Sequelize CLI, providing version-controlled schema changes. This allows for:

- Tracking changes to the database schema over time
- Easy rollback of changes if needed
- Consistent database structure across different environments

To run migrations:

PostgreSQL is used as the primary database, with the following main tables:

- Users: Stores user account information
- Resources: Contains details about educational resources
- UserInteractions: Tracks user activities and preferences
- Comments: Stores user comments on resources

- YouTube Data API:
  - Used for fetching video resources and metadata
  - Requires API key for authentication
  - Allows searching for educational content
  - Provides video statistics (views, likes, etc.)

## Machine Learning

The Learning Resource Hub implements basic machine learning algorithms for personalized recommendations. This section provides an overview of the implemented techniques:

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is used to suggest resources based on similar user preferences:

- Algorithm: User-based collaborative filtering
- Implementation: Using the Surprise library in Python
- Purpose: Recommends resources that similar users have found helpful
- Key features:
  - Calculates user similarity based on interaction history
  - Predicts ratings for unseen resources
  - Recommends top-N resources with highest predicted ratings

### Content-based Filtering

Content-based filtering utilizes resource metadata and user interaction history:

- Algorithm: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with cosine similarity
- Implementation: Using scikit-learn library in Python
- Purpose: Recommends resources similar to those the user has previously interacted with
- Key features:
  - Creates feature vectors for resources based on metadata (title, description, tags)
  - Builds user profiles based on their interaction history
  - Calculates similarity between user profiles and resource feature vectors
  - Recommends resources with highest similarity scores

### Hybrid Approach

The system combines both collaborative and content-based filtering:

- Implementation: Weighted average of recommendations from both methods
- Purpose: Leverages strengths of both approaches for more accurate recommendations
- Key features:
  - Adjustable weights for each method based on performance
  - Helps mitigate cold-start problem for new users or resources

For more detailed information on the machine learning implementation, please refer to the `/docs/machine_learning` directory in the project repository.

## Admin Panel

The admin panel, built with React Admin, provides a comprehensive interface for managing the application. Here's an overview of its key functionalities:

### Content Management
- Add new educational resources to the platform
- Edit existing resource details (title, description, tags, etc.)
- Remove outdated or irrelevant resources
- Bulk actions for efficient resource management

### User Management and Moderation
- View and edit user profiles
- Manage user roles and permissions
- Suspend or ban users violating platform guidelines
- Review and moderate user-generated content (comments, ratings)

### Analytics Dashboard
- Track user engagement metrics (active users, session duration, etc.)
- Monitor popular resources and trending topics
- Visualize user growth and retention rates
- Generate custom reports for specific time periods or user segments

### System Configuration
- Adjust application settings and parameters
